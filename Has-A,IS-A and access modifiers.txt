Has A relationship 
=> In java Has-A relationship simple means that an instance of 
has a reference to a instance of another class or other instance of
the same class.
Eg:A car has an engine and a dog has a tail

public class Bike{
	private String color;
	private int maxSpeed;
	
	public void bikeInfo(){
		System.out.println("bike color" +color+"Bike speed "+maxSpeed);
	}
	
	public void setColor(String color){
		this.color=color;
	}
	public void setmaxSpeed(int maxSpeed){
		this.maxSpeed=maxSpeed
	
	}

}
class roadbike extends Bike{
	public void start(){
		System.out.println("Engine is started")
	}
	public void stop(){
		System.out.println("Engine is stop")
	}	

}
class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		sportbike s=new sportbike()
		s.setColor("black")
		s.setmaxSpeed(180)
		s.start();
		s.stop();
	
	}
}



Is-A relationship
=>In object oriented programming,the concept of Is-A is totally based 
on inheritance which can be of two types class inheritance or interface
inheritance
Eg: Apple is fruit
public class Bike{
	private String color;
	private int maxSpeed;
	
	public void bikeInfo(){
		System.out.println("bike color" +color+"Bike speed "+maxSpeed);
	}
	
	public void setColor(String color){
		this.color=color;
	}
	public void setmaxSpeed(int maxSpeed){
		this.maxSpeed=maxSpeed
	
	}

}

class roadbike extends Bike{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Bike b=new sportbike()
		b.setColor("black")
		b.setmaxSpeed(180)
		System.out.println(b.getColor());
		System.out.println(b.getmaxSpeed());
	
	}
}



Explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?
=>The access modifier in java shows the accessibility or scope of the field
method,constructors and class.We can change the access of level,field,constructor by
applying the access modifiers on it.
there are four types of access of modifiers
1 public
2 protected 
3 private
4 default
